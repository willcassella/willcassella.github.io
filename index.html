            </div>
            <p>
                This past year my life has been divided between two different cities; this mix attempts to capture my experience of moving to one place
                while trying to not truly leave another. Featuring some of my favorite tracks over the past couple years, the first hour consists largely
                of the kind of downtempo, deep, and organic house that has kept me company through airports and at the office, while hour two shifts into
                some of the progressive house and trance that I escape to on long runs. Enjoy!

                This has been a pretty hard year, but at least that means things will get better. Here's some music for the summer that never happened.

                Duration the second month of quarantine I made a DJ mix with a set of songs that inspire a sense of isolation.

                <h4>Honors senior thesis 2017</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
                For my honors senior thesis project at MSU, I built a game engine from scratch based on the requirements for a idea I had.
                The game is designed to be relaxing, it's not about killing enemies or solving puzzles, it's about exploring the environment and moving forward.
                Building the engine had a few challenges, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Developing a physically based rendering engine</li>
                    <li>Building a lightmapping system on top of <a href="https://www.embree.org">Embree</a></li>
                    <li>Developing a Blender plugin that can be used to edit levels via a network connection to the engine</li>
                </ul>
                The engine is written entirely in C++, and the source code is availabe on Github under the MIT license. I did a brief presentation on its development, the slides are available below.

                <h4>MSU Independent study 2016</h4>
            </div>
            <p>
                For an independent study I worked on during my junior year at MSU, I built a game with the game engine I had been working on since freshman year. It was designed to be a spoof on one of mechanics
                found in games like Unreal Tournament and Quake, where players acquire armor by picking up armor pieces (such as helmets). In Real Tournament every time the player picks up a helmet it gets added to a stack on their head, some of which may
                get knocked off if they walk under a low archway, reducing their overall armor. The game supports two-player competitive mode via split-screen. The full game and engine source code are available on Github.
